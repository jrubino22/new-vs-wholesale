I was the lead developer for a project to create a successful custom shopify wholesale site. This project involved bringing over all
products from the retail store as well as many customizations to the theme. These included making different quantities available to
different customers, different MOQ for different customers, and rendering different views to different customers. Customization
was done via html, css, liquid, and javaScript.
